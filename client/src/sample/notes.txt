to convert all the files to react

--- each card should be mapped data, and plug in the data for each card
--- the functionality like managing the state, pressing the buttons, and swiping cards has to be written with react hooks
    --- on click, swipe the cards left right or up (instead of adding a click event listener)
    --- on swipe, remove the current card from the deck and put it where it needs to go (use touch events, refs, useEffect instead of swipe event listeners)


--- swipe isn't working for actual food items data, only works for example data 
    --- the document selector isn't selecting the cards for some reason
    --- convert the js to react

--- parts to convert
    --- classes to add
    --- tracking current card
    --- on touch (swipe) events
    --- on click buttons to force a swipe
    --- overlays to show yes, no, or favorite
