--- make sidebar functional

--- fixed swipe, but there's still bugs (swiping doesn't always remove all the elements on the card because the elements are placed "on top" of swipecard component so it won't go to the next card until you swipe the swipecard)
    --- fixed swipe

    works, but need to fix the date/time part of reservation, it breaks when you choose a date
